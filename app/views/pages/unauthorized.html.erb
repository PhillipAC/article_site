    You do not have permission to be here. Please do not come back.
<% elsif @view.to_i == 1 %>
    Did you not listen the first time? Please do not come back.
<% elsif @view.to_i == 2 %>
    Listen, this is the 3rd time you have come here. Please do not come back.
<% elsif @view.to_i < 9 %>
    Seriously you have come here <%= @view.to_i + 1 %> times. I will give you
    <%= 9-@view.to_i %> more chances. If you come back you will have a bad time.
<% else %>
    Okay... it seems you are determined. One last warning. If you come back here.
    You WILL have a bad time. But why am I trying to stop you? You obviously
    WANT to have a bad time. So go ahead. Click Refresh. I warned you...
